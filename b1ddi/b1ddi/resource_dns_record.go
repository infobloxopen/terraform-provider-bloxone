// DataRecord Record
//
// A __Record__ object (_dns/record_) represents a DNS resource record in an authoritative zone.
//
// For creating a DNS resource record, one of the following pairs of fields is required:<ul><li>_name_in_zone_ and _zone_: The system creates the DNS resource record object within the specified zone. The value of the view field is automatically retrieved from the zone object.</li><li>_absolute_name_spec_ and _view_: The system looks for the appropriate zone in the provided view to create the DNS resource record object. The value of the zone field is automatically computed as part of this process.</li></ul>
//
// The _zone_ and _view_ fields cannot be modified while updating a DNS resource record. The _name_in_zone_ and _absolute_name_spec_ fields can be modified. If both fields are modified in the same update, they need to represent the same change.

Can be absolute or relative domain name.<br><br> | Yes\nnegative_ttl | The time interval in seconds for which name servers can cache negative responses for zone. <br><br>Defaults to 900 seconds (15 minutes).<br><br> | No\nrefresh      | The time interval in seconds that specifies how often secondary servers need to send a message to the primary server for a zone to check that their data is current, and retrieve fresh data if it is not.<br><br>Defaults to 10800 seconds (3 hours).<br><br> | No\nretry        | The time interval in seconds for which the secondary server will wait before attempting to recontact the primary server after a connection failure occurs.<br><br>Defaults to 3600 seconds (1 hour).<br><br> | No\nrname        | The domain name which specifies the mailbox of the person responsible for this zone. <br><br> | No\nserial       | An unsigned 32-bit integer that specifies the serial number of the zone. Used to indicate that zone data was updated, so the secondary name server can initiate zone transfer. The range of the value is 0 to 4294967295. <br><br> | No\n\nSubfields for _SRV_ (Service) record:\n\nSubfield | Description                         | Required\n---------|-------------------------------------|---------\nport     | An unsigned 16-bit integer which specifies the port on this target host of this service. The range of the value is 0 to 65535. This is often as specified in Assigned Numbers but need not be.<br><br> | Yes\npriority | An unsigned 16-bit integer which specifies the priority of this target host. The range of the value is 0 to 65535. A client must attempt to contact the target host with the lowest-numbered priority it can reach. Target hosts with the same priority should be tried in an order defined by the _weight_ field.<br><br>| Yes\ntarget   | The domain name of the target host. There must be one or more address records for this name, the name must not be an alias (in the sense of RFC 1034 or RFC 2181).<br><br>A target of \".\" means that the service is decidedly not available at this domain. | Yes\nweight   | An unsigned 16-bit integer which specifies a relative weight for entries with the same priority. The range of the value is 0 to 65535. Larger weights should be given a proportionately higher probability of being selected. Domain administrators should use weight 0 when there isn't any server selection to do, to make the RR easier to read for humans (less noisy). In the presence of records containing weights greater than 0, records with weight 0 should have a very small chance of being selected.<br><br>In the absence of a protocol whose specification calls for the use of other weighting information, a client arranges the SRV RRs of the same priority in the order in which target hosts, specified by the SRV RRs, will be contacted.<br><br>Defaults to 0.<br><br>| No\n\nSubfields for _TXT_ (Text) record:\n\nSubfield | Description                         | Required\n---------|-------------------------------------|---------\ntext     | The semantics of the text depends on the domain where it is found.<br><br> | No\n\nGeneric record can be used to represent any DNS resource record not listed above. \nSubfields for a generic record consist of a list of struct subfields, each having the following sub-subfields:\nSub-subfield | Description                        | Required\n-------------|------------------------------------|---------\ntype         | Following types are supported:<ul><li>_8BIT_: Unsigned 8-bit integer. </li><li> _16BIT_: Unsigned 16-bit integer. </li><li> _32BIT_: Unsigned 32-bit integer. </li><li> _IPV6_: IPv6 address.
