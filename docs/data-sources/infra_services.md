# bloxone_infra_services (Data Source)

Retrieves information about existing Infrastructure Services (a.k.a BloxOne Applications).

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Get services filtered by an attribute
data "bloxone_infra_services" "example_by_attribute" {
  filters = {
    "name" = "example_service"
  }
}

# Get services filtered by tag
data "bloxone_infra_services" "example_by_tag" {
  tag_filters = {
    "region" = "eu"
  }
}

# Get all services
data "bloxone_infra_services" "example_all" {}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `filters` (Map of String) Filter are used to return a more specific list of results. Filters can be used to match resources by specific attributes, e.g. name. If you specify multiple filters, the results returned will have only resources that match all the specified filters.
- `tag_filters` (Map of String) Tag Filters are used to return a more specific list of results filtered by tags. If you specify multiple filters, the results returned will have only resources that match all the specified filters.

### Read-Only

- `results` (Attributes List) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--results))
