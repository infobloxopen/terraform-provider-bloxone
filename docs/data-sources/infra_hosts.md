# bloxone_infra_hosts (Data Source)

Retrieves information about existing Infrastructure Hosts.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Get hosts filtered by an attribute
data "bloxone_infra_hosts" "example_by_attribute" {
  filters = {
    "name" = "example_host"
  }
}

# Get hosts filtered by tag
data "bloxone_infra_hosts" "example_by_tag" {
  tag_filters = {
    "region" = "eu"
  }
}

# Get all hosts
data "bloxone_infra_hosts" "example_all" {}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `filters` (Map of String) Filter are used to return a more specific list of results. Filters can be used to match resources by specific attributes, e.g. name. If you specify multiple filters, the results returned will have only resources that match all the specified filters.
- `retry_if_not_found` (Boolean) If set to `true`, the data source will retry until a matching host is found, or until the Read Timeout expires.
- `tag_filters` (Map of String) Tag Filters are used to return a more specific list of results filtered by tags. If you specify multiple filters, the results returned will have only resources that match all the specified filters.
- `timeouts` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `results` (Attributes List) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--results))

<a id="nestedatt--timeouts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `read` (String) [Duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) to wait before being considered a timeout during read operations. Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Default is 20m.

### Nested Schema for `results`

Required:

- `display_name` (String) The name of the Host (unique).

Optional:

- `description` (String) The description of the Host (optional).
- `ip_space` (String) The IP Space of the Host.
- `location_id` (String) The resource identifier.
- `maintenance_mode` (String)
- `pool_id` (String) The resource identifier.
- `serial_number` (String) The unique serial number of the Host.
- `tags` (Map of String) Tags associated with this Host.

Read-Only:

- `configs` (Attributes List) The list of Host-specific configurations for each Service deployed on this Host. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--results--configs))
- `connectivity_monitor` (Map of String) Represents the connectivity monitor properties of a Host, to enable/disable connectivity monitoring for redundant network interfaces.

  The "endpoint_type" is:
  - `"csp"` for enabling monitoring
  - `""` for disabling monitoring (default)

  Note: Currently, all fields except "endpoint_type" are read-only, and will be overridden to default values in case they are edited.

  Example:
  ```
{
    "connectivity_monitor": {
      "cost":1000000,
      "endpoint_type":"csp",
      "endpoint":"http://csp.infoblox.com",
      "interval":15,
      "failure_threshold":1,
      "success_threshold":2
    }
  }
```
- `created_at` (String) The timestamp of creation of Host.
- `created_by` (String) The creator of the Host (internal use only).
- `host_subtype` (String) The sub-type of a specific Host type.  Example: For Host type BloxOne Appliance, sub-type could be "B105" or "VEP1425"
- `host_type` (String) The type of Host.  Should be one of: 1. NIOS , 2. NIOS HA, 3. BloxOne VM , 4. BloxOne Appliance, 5. BloxOne Container, 6. CNIOS
