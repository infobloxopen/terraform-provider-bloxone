# bloxone_dns_naptr_records (Data Source)

Retrieves information about existing DNS NAPTR resource records.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Get "NAPTR" records filtered by an attribute
data "bloxone_dns_naptr_records" "example_by_attribute" {
  filters = {
    "absolute_name_spec" = "abc.example.com"
  }
}

# Get "NAPTR" records filtered by tag
data "bloxone_dns_naptr_records" "example_by_tag" {
  tag_filters = {
    "region" = "eu"
  }
}

# Get all "NAPTR" records
data "bloxone_dns_naptr_records" "example_all" {}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `filters` (Map of String) Filter are used to return a more specific list of results. Filters can be used to match resources by specific attributes, e.g. name. If you specify multiple filters, the results returned will have only resources that match all the specified filters.
- `tag_filters` (Map of String) Tag Filters are used to return a more specific list of results filtered by tags. If you specify multiple filters, the results returned will have only resources that match all the specified filters.

### Read-Only

- `results` (Attributes List) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--results))
- `type` (String) The DNS resource record type specified in the textual mnemonic format or in the “TYPEnnn” format where “nnn” indicates the numeric type value.

<a id="nestedatt--results--rdata"></a>
### Nested Schema for `results.rdata`

Required:

- `order` (Number) A 16-bit unsigned integer specifying the order in which the NAPTR records must be processed. Low numbers are processed before high numbers, and once a NAPTR is found whose rule “matches” the target, the client must not consider any NAPTRs with a higher value for order (except as noted below for the “flags” field. The range of the value is 0 to 65535.
- `preference` (Number) A 16-bit unsigned integer that specifies the order in which NAPTR records with equal “order” values should be processed, low numbers being processed before high numbers. This is similar to the preference field in an MX record, and is used so domain administrators can direct clients towards more capable hosts or lighter weight protocols. A client may look at records with higher preference values if it has a good reason to do so such as not understanding the preferred protocol or service. The range of the value is 0 to 65535.
- `replacement` (String) The next name to query for NAPTR, SRV, or address records depending on the value of the flags field. This can be an absolute or relative domain name. Can be empty.
- `services` (String) Specifies the service(s) available down this rewrite path. It may also specify the particular protocol that is used to talk with a service. A protocol must be specified if the flags field states that the NAPTR is terminal. If a protocol is specified, but the flags field does not state that the NAPTR is terminal, the next lookup must be for a NAPTR. The client may choose not to perform the next lookup if the protocol is unknown, but that behavior must not be relied upon.

The service field may take any of the values below (using the Augmented BNF of RFC 2234):

service_field = [ [protocol] *(“+” rs)]
protocol = ALPHA * 31 ALPHANUM
rs = ALPHA * 31 ALPHANUM

The protocol and rs fields are limited to 32 characters and must start with an alphabetic character.

For example, an optional protocol specification followed by 0 or more resolution services. Each resolution service is indicated by an initial ‘+’ character.

Note that the empty string is also a valid service field. This will typically be seen at the beginning of a series of rules, when it is impossible to know what services and protocols will be offered by a particular service.

The actual format of the service request and response will be determined by the resolution protocol. Protocols need not offer all services. The labels for service requests shall be formed from the set of characters [A-Z0-9]. The case of the alphabetic characters is not significant.

Optional:

- `flags` (String) A character string containing flags to control aspects of the rewriting and interpretation of the fields in the DNS resource record. The flags that are currently used are:
U: Indicates that the output maps to a URI (Uniform Record Identifier).
S: Indicates that the output is a domain name that has at least one SRV record. The DNS client must then send a query for the SRV record of the resulting domain name.
A: Indicates that the output is a domain name that has at least one A or AAAA record. The DNS client must then send a query for the A or AAAA record of the resulting domain name.
P: Indicates that the protocol specified in the services field defines the next step or phase.
- `regexp` (String) A string containing a substitution expression that is applied to the original string held by the client in order to construct the next domain name to lookup.

Defaults to none.
