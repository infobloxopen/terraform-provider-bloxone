# bloxone_ipam_addresses (Data Source)

Retrieves information about existing Addresses.

The Address object represents any single IP address within a given IP space.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Get subnets filtered by an attribute
data "bloxone_ipam_addresses" "example_by_attribute" {
  filters = {
    "address" = "10.0.0.0"
  }
}

# Get addresses filtered by tag
data "bloxone_ipam_addresses" "example_by_tag" {
  tag_filters = {
    "region" = "eu"
  }
}

# Get all addresses
data "bloxone_ipam_addresses" "example_all" {}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `filters` (Map of String) Filter are used to return a more specific list of results. Filters can be used to match resources by specific attributes, e.g. name. If you specify multiple filters, the results returned will have only resources that match all the specified filters.
- `tag_filters` (Map of String) Tag Filters are used to return a more specific list of results filtered by tags. If you specify multiple filters, the results returned will have only resources that match all the specified filters.

### Read-Only

- `results` (Attributes List) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--results))
