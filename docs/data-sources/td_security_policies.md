# bloxone_td_security_policies (Data Source)

Retrieves information on existing Security Policies.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Get Security Policies filtered by an attribute
data "bloxone_td_security_policies" "example_by_attribute" {
  filters = {
    "name" = "example_security_policy"
  }
}

# Get Security Policies filtered by tag
data "bloxone_td_security_policies" "example_by_tag" {
  tag_filters = {
    "region" = "eu"
  }
}

# Get all Security Policies
data "bloxone_td_security_policies" "example_all" {}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `filters` (Map of String) Filter are used to return a more specific list of results. Filters can be used to match resources by specific attributes, e.g. name. If you specify multiple filters, the results returned will have only resources that match all the specified filters.
- `tag_filters` (Map of String) Tag Filters are used to return a more specific list of results filtered by tags. If you specify multiple filters, the results returned will have only resources that match all the specified filters.

### Read-Only

- `results` (Attributes List) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--results))
