# bloxone_dfp_services (Data Source)

Retrieves information on all DNS Forwarding Proxy services.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Get DFP Services filtered by an attribute
data "bloxone_dfp_services" "test" {
  filters = {
    service_name = "example_dfp_service"
  }
}

# Get all DFP Services
data "bloxone_dfp_services" "example_all" {}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `filters` (Map of String) Filter are used to return a more specific list of results. Filters can be used to match resources by specific attributes, e.g. name. If you specify multiple filters, the results returned will have only resources that match all the specified filters.

### Read-Only

- `results` (Attributes List) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--results))
