# bloxone_dns_caa_records (Data Source)

Retrieves information about existing DNS CAA resource records.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Get "CAA" records filtered by an attribute
data "bloxone_dns_caa_records" "example_by_attribute" {
  filters = {
    "absolute_name_spec" = "abc.example.com"
  }
}

# Get "CAA" records filtered by tag
data "bloxone_dns_caa_records" "example_by_tag" {
  tag_filters = {
    "region" = "eu"
  }
}

# Get all "CAA" records
data "bloxone_dns_caa_records" "example_all" {}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `filters` (Map of String) Filter are used to return a more specific list of results. Filters can be used to match resources by specific attributes, e.g. name. If you specify multiple filters, the results returned will have only resources that match all the specified filters.
- `tag_filters` (Map of String) Tag Filters are used to return a more specific list of results filtered by tags. If you specify multiple filters, the results returned will have only resources that match all the specified filters.

### Read-Only

- `results` (Attributes List) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--results))
- `type` (String) The DNS resource record type specified in the textual mnemonic format or in the “TYPEnnn” format where “nnn” indicates the numeric type value.

<a id="nestedatt--results--rdata"></a>
### Nested Schema for `results.rdata`

Required:

- `tag` (String) The CAA record property tag string which indicates the type of CAA record. The following property tags are defined by RFC 6844:
issue: Used to explicitly authorize CA to issue certificates for the domain in which the property is published.
issuewild: Used to explicitly authorize a single CA to issue wildcard certificates for the domain in which the property is published.
iodef: Used to specify an email address or URL to report invalid certificate requests or issuers’ certificate policy violations.
Note: issuewild type takes precedence over issue.
- `value` (String) A string which contains the CAA record property value.

Specifies the CA who is authorized to issue a certificate for the domain if the CAA record property tag is issue or issuewild.

Specifies the URL/email address to report CAA policy violation for the domain if the CAA record property tag is iodef.

Optional:

- `flags` (Number) An unsigned 8-bit integer which specifies the CAA record flags. RFC 6844 defines one (highest) bit in flag octet, remaining bits are deferred for future use. This bit is referenced as Critical. When the bit is set (flag value == 128), issuers must not issue certificates in case CAA records contain unknown property tags.
