  Retrieves information about existing DNS resource records. The record type is specified with the type attribute.
  For the following record types, use the terraform data source for the corresponding resource type, e.g. bloxone_dns_a_record - A, AAAA, CAA, CNAME, DNAME, MX, NAPTR, NS, PTR, SRV, TXT, HTTPS, SVCB

# bloxone_dns_records (Data Source)

Retrieves information about existing DNS resource records. The record type is specified with the `type` attribute.

For the following record types, use the terraform data source for the corresponding resource type, e.g. `bloxone_dns_a_record` - _A_, _AAAA_, _CAA_, _CNAME_, _DNAME_, _MX_, _NAPTR_, _NS_, _PTR_, _SRV_, _TXT_, _HTTPS_, _SVCB_

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Get records filtered by an attribute
data "bloxone_dns_records" "example_by_attribute" {
  type = "TYPE256"
  filters = {
    absolute_name_spec = "abc.example.com"
  }
}

# Get records filtered by tag
data "bloxone_dns_records" "example_by_tag" {
  type = "TYPE256"
  tag_filters = {
    "region" = "eu"
  }
}

# Get all records
data "bloxone_dns_records" "example_all" {}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `type` (String) The DNS resource record type specified in the textual mnemonic format or in the “TYPEnnn” format where “nnn” indicates the numeric type value.

### Optional

- `filters` (Map of String) Filter are used to return a more specific list of results. Filters can be used to match resources by specific attributes, e.g. name. If you specify multiple filters, the results returned will have only resources that match all the specified filters.
- `tag_filters` (Map of String) Tag Filters are used to return a more specific list of results filtered by tags. If you specify multiple filters, the results returned will have only resources that match all the specified filters.

### Read-Only

- `results` (Attributes List) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--results))
