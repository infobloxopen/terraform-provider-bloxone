# bloxone_dns_ns_record (Resource)

Manages a DNS NS resource record in an authoritative zone.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "bloxone_dns_auth_zone" "example" {
  fqdn         = "example.com."
  primary_type = "cloud"
}

resource "bloxone_dns_ns_record" "example" {
  rdata = {
    dname = "ns1.example.com"
  }
  zone = bloxone_dns_auth_zone.example.id

  # Other optional fields
  name_in_zone = "ns"
  comment      = "Example comment"
  disabled     = false
  ttl          = 3600
  tags = {
    location = "site1"
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `rdata` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--rdata))

### Optional

- `absolute_name_spec` (String) Synthetic field, used to determine _zone_ and/or _name_in_zone_ field for records.
- `comment` (String) The description for the DNS resource record. May contain 0 to 1024 characters. Can include UTF-8.

  | _DYNAMIC_                           | Record was created dynamically by performing dynamic update. Valid for all record types except _SOA_.                                                           |

  | _DTC_                               | Record was created automatically based on the DTC configuration. Always extends the _SYSTEM_ bit. Valid only for _IBMETA_ record type with _LBDN_ subtype.      |
  | _STATIC_, _SYSTEM_                  | Record was created manually by API call but it is obfuscated by record generated based on name server assignment.                                               |
  | _DYNAMIC_, _SYSTEM_                 | Record was created dynamically by DDNS but it is obfuscated by record generated based on name server assignment.                                                |
