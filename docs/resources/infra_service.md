# bloxone_infra_service (Resource)

Manages an Infrastructure Service (a.k.a BloxOne Applications).

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "bloxone_infra_hosts" "example" {
  filters = {
    display_name = "example-host"
  }
}

resource "bloxone_infra_service" "example" {
  name         = "example_service"
  pool_id      = data.bloxone_infra_hosts.example.results.0.pool_id
  service_type = "dhcp"

  # Other Optional fields
  description     = "DHCP service"
  desired_version = "3.5.0"
  desired_state   = "start"
  tags = {
    site = "Site A"
  }
}
```

  | DHCP                  | dhcp         | 
  | DNS                   | dns          | 
  | DNS Forwarding Proxy  | dfp          | 
  | NIOS Grid Connector   | orpheus      | 
  | MS AD Sync            | msad         | 
  | NTP                   | ntp          |

### Optional

- `description` (String) The description of the Service (optional).

- `desired_version` (String) The desired version of the Service.
- `interface_labels` (List of String) List of interfaces on which this Service can operate. Note: The list can contain custom interface labels (Example: `["WAN","LAN","label1","label2"]`)
- `tags` (Map of String) Tags associated with this Service.
- `timeouts` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--timeouts))
- `wait_for_state` (Boolean) If set to `true`, the resource will wait for the desired state to be reached before returning. If set to `false`, the resource will return immediately after the request is sent to the API.
