# bloxone_ipam_address (Resource)

Manages an Address.

The Address object represents any single IP address within a given IP space.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "bloxone_ipam_ip_space" "example" {
  name = "example_ip_space"
}

resource "bloxone_ipam_address_block" "example" {
  address = "10.0.0.0"
  cidr    = 8
  space   = bloxone_ipam_ip_space.example.id
}

resource "bloxone_ipam_subnet" "example" {
  address = "10.1.0.0"
  cidr    = 24
  space   = bloxone_ipam_ip_space.example.id
}

resource "bloxone_ipam_range" "example" {
  address = "10.1.0.10"
  end     = "10.1.0.20"
  space   = bloxone_ipam_ip_space.example.id
}


resource "bloxone_ipam_address" "example" {
  address = "10.1.0.1"
  space   = bloxone_ipam_ip_space.example.id

  # Other optional fields
  comment = "reservation for Site A"
  names = [
    {
      name = "bby-1"
      type = "user"
    }
  ]
  tags = {
    site = "Site A"
  }

  depends_on = [bloxone_ipam_subnet.example]
}

# Next available address in subnet
resource "bloxone_ipam_address" "example_na_s" {
  next_available_id = bloxone_ipam_subnet.example.id
  space             = bloxone_ipam_ip_space.example.id

  # Other optional fields
  comment = "reservation for Site A"

      name = "bby-1"
      type = "user"
    }
  ]
  tags = {
    site = "Site A"
  }
}

# Next available address in address block
resource "bloxone_ipam_address" "example_na_ab" {
  next_available_id = bloxone_ipam_address_block.example.id
  space             = bloxone_ipam_ip_space.example.id

  # Other optional fields
  comment = "reservation for Site A"
  names = [
    {
      name = "bby-1"
      type = "user"
    }
  ]
  tags = {
    site = "Site A"
  }
}

# Next available address in range
resource "bloxone_ipam_address" "example_na_rng" {
  next_available_id = bloxone_ipam_range.example.id
  space             = bloxone_ipam_ip_space.example.id

  # Other optional fields
  comment = "reservation for Site A"
  names = [
    {
      name = "bby-1"
      type = "user"
    }
  ]

### Nested Schema for `names`

Required:

- `name` (String) The name expressed as a single label or FQDN.
- `type` (String) The origin of the name.


<a id="nestedatt--dhcp_info"></a>
### Nested Schema for `dhcp_info`

Read-Only:

- `client_hostname` (String) The DHCP host name associated with this client.
- `client_hwaddr` (String) The hardware address associated with this client.
- `client_id` (String) The ID associated with this client.

Valid values are: * _DHCPv6NonTemporaryAddress_: DHCPv6 non-temporary address (NA) * _DHCPv6TemporaryAddress_: DHCPv6 temporary address (TA) * _DHCPv6PrefixDelegation_: DHCPv6 prefix delegation (PD) * _DHCPv4_: DHCPv4 lease
- `preferred_lifetime` (String) The length of time that a valid address is preferred (i.e., the time until deprecation). When the preferred lifetime expires, the address becomes deprecated on the client. It is still considered leased on the server. Applicable only for DHCPv6.

The lease details are contained in the matching _dhcp/lease_ resource.
- `state_ts` (String) The timestamp at which the _state_ was last reported.
