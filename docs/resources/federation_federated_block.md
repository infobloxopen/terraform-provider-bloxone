# bloxone_federation_federated_block (Resource)

Manages a Federated Block.

The Federated Block object allows a uniform representation of the address space segmentation, supporting functions such as administrative grouping, routing aggregation, delegation etc.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "bloxone_federation_federated_realm" "example" {
  name = "example_federation_federated_realm"
}

resource "bloxone_federation_federated_block" "example" {
  name            = "example_federation_federated_block"
  federated_realm = bloxone_federation_federated_realm.example.id
  cidr            = 24
  address         = "10.10.0.0"

  //tags
  tags = {
    site = "Site A"
  }
}
```
