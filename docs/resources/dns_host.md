# bloxone_dns_host (Resource)

Manages DNS Hosts.

A DNS Host object associates a DNS Config Profile with an on-prem host.

Note: This resource represents an existing backend object that cannot be created or deleted through API calls. Instead, it can only be updated. When using terraform apply the resource configuration is applied to the existing object, and no new object is created. Similarly terraform destroy removes the configuration associated with the object without actually deleting it from the backend.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "bloxone_infra_hosts" "host" {
  filters = {
    display_name = "my-host"
  }
}

resource "bloxone_dns_server" "dns_server" {
  name = "my-dns-server"
}

resource "bloxone_dns_host" "example_dns_host" {
  id     = data.bloxone_infra_hosts.host.results.0.legacy_id
  server = bloxone_dns_server.dns_server.id

  # Other Optional fields
  tags = {
    site = "Site A"
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `id` (String) The resource identifier.

### Optional

- `absolute_name` (String) Host FQDN.
- `inheritance_sources` (Attributes) Optional. Inheritance configuration. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--inheritance_sources))
- `kerberos_keys` (Attributes List) Optional. _kerberos_keys_ contains a list of keys for GSS-TSIG signed dynamic updates.  Defaults to empty. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--kerberos_keys))
- `retry_if_not_found` (Boolean) If set to `true`, the resource will retry until a matching host is found, or until the Create Timeout expires.
- `server` (String) The resource identifier.
- `timeouts` (Block, Optional) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `address` (String) Host's primary IP Address.
- `anycast_addresses` (List of String) Anycast address configured to the host. Order is not significant.

- `comment` (String) Host description.
- `current_version` (String) Host current version.
- `dfp` (Boolean) Below _dfp_ field is deprecated and not supported anymore. The indication whether or not BloxOne DDI DNS and BloxOne TD DFP are both active on the host will be migrated into the new _dfp_service_ field.
- `dfp_service` (String) DFP service indicates whether or not BloxOne DDI DNS and BloxOne TD DFP are both active on the host. If so, BloxOne DDI DNS will augment recursive queries and forward them to BloxOne TD DFP. Allowed values:  * _unavailable_: BloxOne TD DFP application is not available,  * _enabled_: BloxOne TD DFP application is available and enabled,  * _disabled_: BloxOne TD DFP application is available but disabled.
- `name` (String) Host display name.
- `ophid` (String) On-Prem Host ID.
- `protocol_absolute_name` (String) Host FQDN in punycode.
- `provider_id` (String) External provider identifier.
- `site_id` (String) Host site ID.
- `tags` (Map of String) Host tagging specifics.
- `tags_all` (Map of String) Host tagging specifics includes default tags.
- `type` (String) Defines the type of host. Allowed values:  * _bloxone_ddi_: host type is BloxOne DDI,  * _microsoft_azure_: host type is Microsoft Azure,  * _amazon_web_service_: host type is Amazon Web Services,  * _microsoft_active_directory_: host type is Microsoft Active Directory,  * _google_cloud_platform_: host type is Google Cloud Platform.
