// DataRecord Record
//
// A __Record__ object (_dns/record_) represents a DNS resource record in an authoritative zone.
//
// For creating a DNS resource record, one of the following pairs of fields is required:<ul><li>_name_in_zone_ and _zone_: The system creates the DNS resource record object within the specified zone. The value of the view field is automatically retrieved from the zone object.</li><li>_absolute_name_spec_ and _view_: The system looks for the appropriate zone in the provided view to create the DNS resource record object. The value of the zone field is automatically computed as part of this process.</li></ul>
//
// The _zone_ and _view_ fields cannot be modified while updating a DNS resource record. The _name_in_zone_ and _absolute_name_spec_ fields can be modified. If both fields are modified in the same update, they need to represent the same change.

	// flags       | A character string containing flags to control aspects of the rewriting and interpretation of the fields in the DNS resource record. The flags that are currently used are: <ul><li> __U__: Indicates that the output maps to a URI (Uniform Record Identifier). </li><li> __S__: Indicates that the output is a domain name that has at least one SRV record. The DNS client must then send a query for the SRV record of the resulting domain name. </li><li> __A__: Indicates that the output is a domain name that has at least one A or AAAA record.

	// order       | A 16-bit unsigned integer specifying the order in which the NAPTR records must be processed.

	// preference  |A 16-bit unsigned integer that specifies the order in which NAPTR records with equal "order" values should be processed, low numbers being processed before high numbers. This is similar to the preference field in an MX record, and is used so domain administrators can direct clients towards more capable hosts or lighter weight protocols. A client may look at records with higher preference values if it has a good reason to do so such as not understanding the preferred protocol or service.

	// services | Specifies the service(s) available down this rewrite path. It may also specify the particular protocol that is used to talk with a service. A protocol must be specified if the flags field states that the NAPTR is terminal. If a protocol is specified, but the flags field does not state that the NAPTR is terminal, the next lookup must be for a NAPTR. The client may choose not to perform the next lookup if the protocol is unknown, but that behavior must not be relied upon.<br><br>The service field may take any of the values below (using the Augmented BNF of RFC 2234):<br><br>service_field = [ [protocol] *("+" rs)]<br>protocol = ALPHA * 31 ALPHANUM<br>rs = ALPHA * 31 ALPHANUM<br><br>The protocol and rs fields are limited to 32 characters and must start with an alphabetic character.<br><br> For example, an optional protocol specification followed by 0 or more resolution services. Each resolution service is indicated by an initial '+' character.<br><br> Note that the empty string is also a valid service field.  This will typically be seen at the beginning of a series of rules, when it is impossible to know what services and protocols will be offered by a particular service.<br><br> The actual format of the service request and response will be determined by the resolution protocol. Protocols need not offer all services. The labels for service requests shall be formed from the set of characters [A-Z0-9]. The case of the alphabetic characters is not significant.<br><br> | Yes

	// priority | An unsigned 16-bit integer which specifies the priority of this target host. The range of the value is 0 to 65535. A client must attempt to contact the target host with the lowest-numbered priority it can reach. Target hosts with the same priority should be tried in an order defined by the _weight_ field.<br><br>| Yes
	// target   | The domain name of the target host. There must be one or more address records for this name, the name must not be an alias (in the sense of RFC 1034 or RFC 2181).<br><br>A target of "." means that the service is decidedly not available at this domain. | Yes
	// weight   | An unsigned 16-bit integer which specifies a relative weight for entries with the same priority. The range of the value is 0 to 65535. Larger weights should be given a proportionately higher probability of being selected. Domain administrators should use weight 0 when there isn't any server selection to do, to make the RR easier to read for humans (less noisy). In the presence of records containing weights greater than 0, records with weight 0 should have a very small chance of being selected.<br><br>In the absence of a protocol whose specification calls for the use of other weighting information, a client arranges the SRV RRs of the same priority in the order in which target hosts, specified by the SRV RRs, will be contacted.<br><br>Defaults to 0.<br><br>| No
