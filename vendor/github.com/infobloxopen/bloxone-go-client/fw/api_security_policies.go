BloxOne FW API

BloxOne Threat Defense Cloud is an extension of the BloxOne Suite that provides visibility into infected and compromised off-premises devices, roaming users, remote sites, and branch offices. You can subscribe to BloxOne Cloud and use its functionality to mitigate and control malware as well as provide unprecedented insight into your network security posture and enable timely action. BloxOne Cloud also offers unified policy management, reporting, and threat analytics across the entire spectrum. Using automated and high-quality threat intelligence feeds and unique behavioral analytics, it automatically stops device communications with C&Cs/botnets and prevents DNS based data exfiltration.  The mission-critical DNS infrastructure can become a vulnerable component in your network when it is inadequately protected by traditional security solutions and consequently used as an attack surface. Compromised DNS services can result in catastrophic network and system failures. To fully protect your network in today’s cyber security threat environment, Infoblox sets a new DNS security standard by offering scalable, enterprise-grade, and integrated protection for your DNS infrastructure.  Through the Infoblox Cloud Services Portal, you can view the status of your subscription and threat intelligence feeds, manage your network scope and roaming end users, and learn more about threats on your networks through the Infoblox Threat Lookup tool and predefined reports.

			CreateSecurityPolicy Create Security Policy.

			Use this method to create a Security Policy object. If no rule list is specified, the newly created Security Policy object will create these rules as a copy of default Security Policy rules ("Default Global Policy"). If rule list is provided it must contain at least the complete list of policy rules, including the rules based on all feeds that the account is entitled to. If no network list is specified, networking scope for this policy is empty, thus no action can be performed by this policy. Note that you are not allowed to add DNS Forwarding Proxies and Roaming Device Groups that are already assigned to a Security Policy different from "Default Global Policy", to assign them to this Security Policy object you should remove them from other Security Policy first.

		A security policy defines a set of rules and actions that you define to balance access and constraints so you can mitigate malicious attacks and provide security for your networks. When you create a new security policy, you first define a network scope to which you add networks, DNS forwarding proxies, and BloxOne Endpoint groups. BloxOne Cloud applies the security policy to all the entities that you include in the network scope. You can also include DNS forwarding proxies to which you want to apply the security policy.  After you define the network scope, you can add custom lists and category filters to the security policy. You can also specify actions for the added lists and filters, and to determine the precedence order for the entities. Depending on your subscription level, each security policy also comes with a set of predefined threat intelligence feeds and Threat Insight rules that are inherited from the default global policy. You cannot delete the inherited feeds and rules, but you can change their precedence order. For each policy you can define policy-level action (Default Action) gets applied when none of the policy rules apply/match. If an user really needs access to some blocked domain (web page) via a browser - there is a possibility to assign special bypass code(s) (Bypass Code) to any policy.

Use this method to retrieve information on all Security Policy objects for the account.

A security policy defines a set of rules and actions that you define to balance access and constraints so you can mitigate malicious attacks and provide security for your networks. When you create a new security policy, you first define a network scope to which you add networks, DNS forwarding proxies, and BloxOne Endpoint groups. BloxOne Cloud applies the security policy to all the entities that you include in the network scope. You can also include DNS forwarding proxies to which you want to apply the security policy.  After you define the network scope, you can add custom lists and category filters to the security policy. You can also specify actions for the added lists and filters, and to determine the precedence order for the entities. Depending on your subscription level, each security policy also comes with a set of predefined threat intelligence feeds and Threat Insight rules that are inherited from the default global policy. You cannot delete the inherited feeds and rules, but you can change their precedence order. For each policy you can define policy-level action (Default Action) gets applied when none of the policy rules apply/match. If an user really needs access to some blocked domain (web page) via a browser - there is a possibility to assign special bypass code(s) (Bypass Code) to any policy.

UpdateSecurityPolicy Update Security Policy.

Use this method to update a specified Network List object. The policy data supplied with the update request must have the complete list of policy rules, including the rules based on all feeds that the account is entitled to. If no network list is specified, networking scope for this policy is empty, thus no action can be performed by this policy. Note that you are not allowed to add DNS Forwarding Proxies and Roaming Device Groups that are already assigned to a Security Policy different from "Default Global Policy", to assign them to this Security Policy object you should remove them from other Security Policy first.

A security policy defines a set of rules and actions that you define to balance access and constraints so you can mitigate malicious attacks and provide security for your networks. When you create a new security policy, you first define a network scope to which you add networks, DNS forwarding proxies, and BloxOne Endpoint groups. BloxOne Cloud applies the security policy to all the entities that you include in the network scope. You can also include DNS forwarding proxies to which you want to apply the security policy.  After you define the network scope, you can add custom lists and category filters to the security policy. You can also specify actions for the added lists and filters, and to determine the precedence order for the entities. Depending on your subscription level, each security policy also comes with a set of predefined threat intelligence feeds and Threat Insight rules that are inherited from the default global policy. You cannot delete the inherited feeds and rules, but you can change their precedence order. For each policy you can define policy-level action (Default Action) gets applied when none of the policy rules apply/match.
